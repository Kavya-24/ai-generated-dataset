### Definition
CSV file with 100 records. Header = 'request'
This dataset has 100 rows each representing an operational request for a saas company in 10-25 words
The generative model used for this is https://huggingface.co/microsoft/Phi-3-mini-4k-instruct

### Further considerations
The script can be used for generating more than 100 tickets given that correct configuration of hardware accelerators, better generative models with more parameters, refining the prompt, tweaking the temperature, using more computational resources etc.
